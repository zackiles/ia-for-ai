## Internal Documentation System Evaluation Framework
This framework defines a comprehensive evaluation rubric for assessing and designing internal documentation systems in an enterprise. It outlines 12 dimensions—ranging from content lifecycle management, discoverability, and usability, to governance, traceability, AI integration, and technical infrastructure. Each category identifies specific criteria for evaluating how well a system supports scalable, reliable, compliant, and user-centric knowledge management. The framework ultimately supports decision-making around documentation tooling, process maturity, and long-term knowledge resilience.

## Dimensions and Criteria

### 1\. Content Management

How we organize and maintain documentation throughout its lifecycle.

* Document lifecycle management  
* Version control and history  
* Content ownership and stewardship  
* Archival and deprecation processes  
* Content templates and standardization  
* Content validation / linting workflows

## 2\. Discoverability

How users find and navigate to the information they need when they need it.

* Search functionality and relevance  
* Taxonomies and categorization  
* Tagging systems  
* Navigation and information architecture  
* Cross-referencing and related content  
* Integrations (Backstage, Google Cloud Search)

## 3\. Usability

How we ensure documentation is accessible, readable, and provides a good user experience.

* Editing experience  
  * Markdown formats may differ when you can ‘bring-your-own’ editor  
* Accessibility compliance  
  * **Examples:**  
    * Color-blindness, and general accessibility especially if documents could be shared outside of the organization or with partners.  
* Interactive and/or dynamically generated elements (tables, diagrams etc)  
  * Not all content is human generated or maintained

## 4\. Documentation as Code

How we treat documentation with the same rigor and processes as software development.

* Markdown support  
* Diagramming support (e.g. mermaid.js)  
* Git integration  
* CI/CD for documentation  
* Code snippet handling  
* API documentation generation  
* Automated testing for documentation

## 5\. Collaboration

How teams work together to create, review, and improve documentation.

* Real-time co-editing  
* Review workflows and approvals  
  * Define level of process/review required for documentation depending on the content  
* Comment and feedback systems  
* Change notifications  
* Team spaces and permissions  
* Cross-team collaboration capabilities

## 6\. Integration

How our documentation system connects with other tools and platforms in our workflow.

* Tool integrations  
  * **Examples:**  
    * Cloud: Salesforce, GCP, GDrive, Office365 etc  
    * Editors and CMS: IDE, GitHub, Gitlab etc  
    * Incident management software: Blameless, Incident.io etc  
* Chat platform integrations  
  * **Examples:**  
    * Slack, Teams etc.  
* Operations  
  * **Examples**  
    * Jira, Jira Service desk ticket integrations etc  
* Knowledge base linking (how do documents link to one another?)  
  * **Examples:**  
    * Notion, Backstage, Confluence, Github etc  
* Identity and access management  
  * **Examples:**  
    * Groups, roles, fine-grained access, access patterns etc.  
* API access and extensibility

## 7\. Traceability

How we maintain connections between documentation, code, and decisions.

* Related code references  
  * **Examples:**  
    * Tagged to code versions/commits, embedded code snippets/links etc  
* Decision history / auditability  
* Requirements traceability  
  * **Examples:**  
    * Zendesk, Jira, Clerk etc  
* Change impact analysis  
  * **Examples:**  
    * Changelog, release notes, release hooks, feature flag documentation etc  
* Document dependencies

## 8\. Metrics and Analytics

How we measure the success of a documentation initiative.

* Documentation usage statistics  
* Content gaps analysis  
  * Ability to quickly roll-up and identify incomplete or outdated documentation  
  * **Examples:**  
    * Out of date API specifications/service runbooks/release notes  
* Search effectiveness metrics  
  * **Examples:**  
    * How often is search and its results used  
* Documentation health scores  
  * **Examples:**  
    * Team engagement metrics, overall ROI/business value

## 9\. AI and Automation

How our systems integrate with and demonstrate AI-native principles of documentation.

* RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)  
  * **Examples:**  
    * Data and AI teams ease of integrations  
* Editor  
  * **Examples:**  
    * Auto-summarization  
* Content generation assistance  
* Translation capabilities  
  * **Examples:**  
    * Auto Spanish, French English  
* Smart recommendations  
  * **Examples:**  
    * Chits, auto-linking  
* Question-answering capabilities

## 10\. Governance

How we establish and enforce policies for documentation management and quality.

* Documentation standards enforcement  
* Security and Compliance classification  
  * **Examples:**  
    * Data loss prevention integrations, categorization etc
* Access controls  
* Documentation reviews  
* Information retention policies

## 11\. Knowledge Transfer

How we capture, preserve, and share institutional knowledge across the organization.

* Onboarding documentation  
* Training materials  
* Expertise location  
* Tribal knowledge capture  
* Best practices repository  
* Post-mortem documentation

## 12\. Technical Considerations

How we address the infrastructure and technical requirements of our documentation system.

* Performance and scalability  
* Offline access capabilities  
* Hosting and infrastructure  
* Backup and disaster recovery  
* Cost management  
* Migration pathways
