# Core Semantic Principles
principles:
  density: 
    definition: maximize_information_per_token
    description: "Condense information to express maximum meaning with minimum tokens"
    examples:
      - "Using symbols (→, ⊕, Σ) instead of verbose text"
      - "Combining related concepts with connector symbols (•, +, ⇌)"
    anti_patterns:
      - "Unnecessary repetition of concepts"
      - "Verbose descriptions that could be symbolized"
  
  abstraction:
    definition: create_cognitive_frameworks
    description: "Develop mental models that organize information hierarchically"
    examples:
      - "Using higher-order categories (↹) to group related concepts"
      - "Creating knowledge trees with parent-child relationships"
    anti_patterns:
      - "Flat, unstructured information presentation"
      - "Missing hierarchical organization"
  
  precision:
    definition: use_unambiguous_symbols
    description: "Choose clear, specific notation that conveys exact meaning"
    examples:
      - "Consistent use of symbols for specific operations (→ for sequence)"
      - "Clearly defined semantic boundaries"
    anti_patterns:
      - "Overloaded symbols with multiple meanings"
      - "Vague or imprecise terminology"
  
  consistency:
    definition: maintain_semantic_integrity
    description: "Use symbols and patterns uniformly throughout the document"
    examples:
      - "Same symbol always represents the same concept"
      - "Uniform structure across similar sections"
    anti_patterns:
      - "Changing notation conventions mid-document"
      - "Inconsistent formatting or hierarchy"
  
  modularity:
    definition: organize_in_functional_units
    description: "Structure content into self-contained, reusable components"
    examples:
      - "Discrete sections with clear boundaries and purposes"
      - "Components that can be referenced and reused"
    anti_patterns:
      - "Monolithic, tightly coupled sections"
      - "Redundant information across multiple sections"

    usage: "Indicates the start of a logical section"
    
  - symbol: "⊕"
    meaning: "element_definition"
    usage: "Defines an element within a section"
    
  - symbol: "→"
    meaning: "sequence_flow"
    usage: "Indicates a sequential step or flow"
    
  - symbol: "Σ"
    meaning: "section_summary"
    usage: "Summarizes or concludes a section"
    
  - symbol: "⨁"
    meaning: "combination"
    usage: "Indicates combining multiple elements"
    
  - symbol: "⇌"
    meaning: "bidirectional_relation"
    usage: "Indicates a bidirectional relationship"
    
  - symbol: "|"
    meaning: "condition_or_property"
    usage: "Indicates a condition or property"
    
  - symbol: "•"
    meaning: "connector"
    usage: "Connects related concepts or terms"
    
  - symbol: "+"
